Project Overview
Landslide risk, frequency, and impact in Southwestern Pennsylvania is worsening. As annual precipitation hits record levels, the growing prevalence of landslides threatens personal property, businesses, and roadways, costing millions of dollars annually in road repairs and other damages.

This project, conducted through Carnegie Mellon University’s Fall 2019 Policy Innovation Lab course, endeavored to understand the factors influencing the probability of new landslides in order to advise North Huntingdon Township (NHT) on landslide risk mitigation strategies. The project’s output includes two sets of recommendations to the Township—one concerning data collection, sharing, and analysis, the other concerning policy interventions—though much research remains to be completed in future groups’ efforts to address this problem.
